    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "Solution: The two values of Boolean data type is 'True' and 'false'.We use 'Bool' as data type and they are represented as T and F(both capital).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "Solution: The three type of Boolean operators are AND, OR , NOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean\n",
    "values for the operator and what it evaluate).\n",
    "Solution: Following is the list:\n",
    "          True and True is True\n",
    "          True and False is Flase\n",
    "          False and True is False\n",
    "          False and False is False\n",
    "          True or True is True\n",
    "          True or False is True\n",
    "          False or True is True\n",
    "          False or False is False\n",
    "          not True is Flase\n",
    "          not False is True.\n",
    "          \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are the values of the following expressions?\n",
    "(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)\n",
    "not (5 > 4)\n",
    "(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)\n",
    "not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))\n",
    "(True and True) and (True == False)\n",
    "(not False) or (not True)\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) is Flase\n",
    "         \n",
    "not (5 > 4) is Flase\n",
    "\n",
    "(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) is True\n",
    "\n",
    "not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) is False\n",
    "\n",
    "(True and True) and (True == False) is Flase\n",

    "5. What are the six comparison operators?\n",
    "Solution: Listing the comparison operators:\n",
    "           <, >, =, <=, >=, !=\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a\n",
    "condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "Solution: The difference between equal and assignment operator is Assignment operator use '=' and equal operator use '=='.\n",
    "          When we want to assign a value to a variable we use assignment operator and we want to compare two values to be\n",
    "          equal or it we use equal operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Identify the three blocks in this code:\n",
    "spam = 0\n",
    "if spam == 10:\n",
    "print('eggs')\n",
    "if spam > 5:\n",
    "print('bacon')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "print('ham')\n",
    "print('spam')\n",
    "print('spam')\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: The three blocks are between the if statement which prints egg adn second bacon and last else part.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints\n",
    "Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.\n",
    "Solution: spam=0;\n",
    "          if spam ==1:\n",
    "          print('Hello')\n",
    "          elif spam==2 :\n",
    "          print('Howdy')\n",
    "          else:\n",
    "          print('Greetings!')\n",
    "          \n",

    "9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?\n",
    "solution: Ctrl+c is pressed to exit a infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "Solution: Break statement terminate the whole loop when some action is against the condition whereas continue statement skip the current iteration and go to the next statement if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "Solution: All the three are same as range(10) call the range from 0-10(not including 10) same as range (0, 10) and range(0, 10, 1) tells about starting point, ending point with difference in both respectively giving same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent\n",
    "program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.\n",
    "Solution: For i in range(1,11):\n",
    "          print i\n",
    "          i++\n",
    "          while i<11:\n",
    "          print i\n",
    "          I\\i++\n",
    "\n",
    "13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after\n",
    "importing spam?\n",
    "Solution: spam.bacon() is correct way to represent."
