    "1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:Excel is more superior when compared with the CSV file format; thus, CSV consumes less amount of file size when the user is importing data; it is a much faster format compared to excel. CSV does not manipulate data and stores it as-is. Excel also allows the user the add-in feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: The csv. writer() function returns a writer object that converts the user's data into a delimited string. This string can later be used to write into CSV files using the writerow() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: A file can be opened with a built-in function called open(). This function takes in the file's address and the access_mode and returns a file object. When you add 'b' to the access modes you can read the file in binary format rather than the default text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:The most common method to write data from a list to CSV file is the writerow() method of writer and DictWriter class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What do the keyword arguments delimiter and line terminator do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:The delimiter is the character that appears between cells on a row. By default, the delimiter for a CSV file is a comma. The line terminator is the character that comes at the end of a row. By default, the line terminator is a newline. You can change characters to different values by using the delimiter and lineterminator keyword arguments with csv.writer().\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What function takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:loads() method return Python data structure of JSON string or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What function takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:ython supports JSON through a built-in package called json and this module can be used to covert a python dictionary to JSON object."
