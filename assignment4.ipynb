    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "Solution: In Python programming, a list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside square brackets [] , separated by commas. It can have any number of items and they may be of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the\n",
    "third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: spam[2]= 'hello'  will assign hello to the third value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c' , 'd' , 'e' ] for the next three queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "Solution: 'd'\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "Solution: 'd'\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the value of spam[:2]?\n",
    "Solution:['a','b']\n",

    "Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "Solution: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "Solution: [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "Solution:[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "Solution: concatenation '+'\n",
    "          replication '*'\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "Solution: append() focus on adding an element in the list at the end and insert(position, new_entry) cares about the position of new entry in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Solution: del statement, remove(), clear() are responsible of removing items from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "Solution: list and string both can be passed with len() function,they have indexes and slices,they both can be used in for loop, can be concatenated or replicated. These features make them similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Solution:The basic difference starts with the parenthesis used, list use [] but tuple use ().List are mutable and comsume more memory, tuples are immutable and use less memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "Solution:(42,)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "Solution:tuple() and list() or using zip.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "Solution:They contain refrences to the list values.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "Solution:A shallow copy i.e. copy.copy() constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original. A deep copy i.e. copy.deepcopy() constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original."
